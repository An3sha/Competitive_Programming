Step 2
File: previous files, form.py

Make a Form class. It has a name (str), a is_signed (bool) indicating whether it is signed (at the
beginning, it’s not), a grade_sign (int) required to sign it, and a grade_exec (int) required to execute it. The grades are subject to the same constraints as in the Bureaucrat, and exceptions will be thrown if any
of them are out of bounds, GradeTooHighException and GradeTooLowException. Same as before, we want to access each attribute from their name (name, is_signed, etc.). When printing the instance, it will
display: “[Form name] sign grade: [grade sign], exec grade: [grade exec], is signed: [True or False]”

Example
“Awesome Form sign grade: 80, exec grade: 40, is signed: False”
