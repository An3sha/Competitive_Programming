Class Design Python

Introduction
------------

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your capacity of designing your code based on a simple logic. The
most important is to do each step in order and be sure to finish one before going for the next one. It’s
better to do less but correctly than everything but wrong. Pay attention to details, especially in what the

expected output is. A mistake of a space, typo, or any other output mistake can conduct to a fail of our
test cases. Pay also attention to examples, they can give you information.
Today, we’re going to create an artificial nightmare of offices, corridors, forms, and waiting in line.
Sounds fun? No? Too bad.
