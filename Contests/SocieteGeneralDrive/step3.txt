Step 3
File: previous files, concrete_forms.py
Now that you have basic forms, you will make a few forms that actually do something. Create a few
concrete forms. The name of the form and the class are the same:

ShrubberyCreationForm (Required grades: sign 145, exec 137). Action: Display “Shrubbery has been planted at [target]”.
RobotomyRequestForm (Required grades: sign 72, exec 45). Action: Display “[target] has been robotomied”
All of these will have to take only one parameter in their constructor, which will represent the target (str) of the form. For example, “home” if you want to plant a shrubbery at home. Now you need to add a method execute to the base class Form, that takes a Bureaucrat in parameter, and implement a method actually executing the form’s action in all the concrete forms. You have to check that the form is signed, and that the bureaucrat attempting to execute the form has a high enough grade, else you will throw an appropriate exception. Whether you want to make these checks in every concrete class or make the check in the base class then calling another method to actually execute the action is up to you, but one way is obviously prettier than the other one.

Finish this by adding a method execute_form that takes a Form to the bureaucrat. It must attempt to execute the form, and if it’s a success, print something like

“[Bureaucrat name] executes [Form name]”. If not, print an explicit error message.
