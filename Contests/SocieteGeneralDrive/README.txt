READ THIS PROPERLY

YOUR QUESTIONS WERE SET WRONGLY

CHECK STEP 2

There was nothing mentioned about the implementation of be_signed() or sign_form()
attribute. Do you want us to guess and code? Does that happen in your organisation?

Now please check the run_tests.py, then go to step2.py.
See how the tests are designed, they want a proper implementation of the above
attributes, but the candidates have no idea of how to implement them because the
question statement has told nothing about such attributes.

I'll be waiting for an early reply regarding this messed up questions.

Hope your authority looks into the issue and designs questions properly next time.
