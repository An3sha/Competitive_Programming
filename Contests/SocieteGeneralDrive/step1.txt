Step 1
File: bureaucrat.py, exception.py

First, we start by the smallest cog in the vast bureaucratic machine: the Bureaucrat. It must have a
constant name (str), and a grade (int): that ranges from 1 (highest possible) to 150 (lowest possible).
Any attempt to create a Bureaucrat with an invalid grade must throw an exception, which will be either
a GradeTooHighException or a GradeTooLowException.

We want to be able to access the name and grade using the attribute name and grade. You will provide
an overload of the right method so the following code will display: “[Bureaucrat name] grade:
[Bureaucrat grade]”
