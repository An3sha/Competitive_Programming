# Competitive Programming

Competitive Programming is a sport. It is a way to keep the brain healthy and fit. It is the gym for the mind.

This repository contains my solutions and codes to various online competitive programming challenges. The links to the problem statements are specified at the beginning of each code. Apart from that, I've also put here some of the very common and important problems and algorithms that are commonly asked in interviews.

It should be noted that none of these solutions are written with respect to best Software Engineering practices. The programs are written the way they're so that solutions to problems in competitions can be submitted as fast as possible. In some cases the codes have small comments for the ease of the reader.
