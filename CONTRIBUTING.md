I am so happy to know that you would want to contribute. There are no specific rules, if you've found a problem that is good enough for interview and you want to showcase your solution - Just go ahead, add it and submit a PR. 

Please follow these very simple guidelines

- Create a new branch for your PR
- Write modular, readable and well-formatted code.
- Please add code which passes all test cases. We love to see the green AC symbol only âœ…
- Please add your name in the README->Contributors section, i.e [here](https://github.com/amitrajitbose/Competitive_Programming#contributors), with the Github avatar link also.

I'll make sure it gets merged at the earliest. Cheers and thanks!
